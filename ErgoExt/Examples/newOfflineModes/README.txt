This directory contains a simple BAT (in simple-bat.scm)) and some simple nondeterministic Ergo programs (in simple.scm) that can be used to illustrate the new offline modes of the ERGO EXTENDED system, i.e., offlineStepAsk, collecting, offlineStep, offlineStepColl.  See simpleRun.txt for some example uses of the new Ergo offline modes.
