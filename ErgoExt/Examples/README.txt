This directory contains a number of small examples illustrating features of the
ERGO EXTENDED system, a branch of the ERGO system 
(from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hector/pcr.html)
developed primarily for implementing probabilistic plan recognition
systems.  It contains the following:

    - README.txt            	   This file
    - newOfflineModes/       Illustrates the new offline modes
    - targetShoot/                Our main probabilistic plan recognition domain where the
                                           agent may shoot at some targets, with a range of solutions
