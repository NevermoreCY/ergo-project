This describes how to setup and run the Ergo Extended software.

First install Racket Scheme and Ergo as described in the Ergo install.txt file.

INSTALLATION OF ERGO EXTENDED SOFTWARE

1- First, copy  all the files in the Ergo/System/ directory to a new directory ErgoExt
   somewhere convenient, away from user ERGO programs.  On a Mac, a reasonable
   choice is to create "~/Library/Application Support/ErgoExt/" and put them there.

   Then replace the files full-system.scm and ergo.scm by the one in ErgoExt/System/.

2- Then find out where Racket keeps user-defined collections.  
   It's the first element of "(current-library-collection-paths)":

   > racket -e '(car (current-library-collection-paths))'
   #<path:/Users/hector/Library/Racket/6.5/collects>

3- Create the user /path/to/collects/ directory from (2) if needed, and a new
   subdirectory inside it called "ergoExt".

4- Put a file called "main.ss" in the "ergoExt" directory from step (3).  It
   should contain just the following three lines:

   (module main racket
     (require (file "/path/to/implementation/full-system.scm"))
     (provide (all-from-out (file "/path/to/implementation/full-system.scm"))))

   where the "/path/to/implementation/" is the directory from step (1) above.

5- Test that ERGO is correctly installed:

   > racket -l ergoExt -e '(ergo-do :nil)'
       Loading ERGO v1.5 (Mar 2018) in Racket v6.5 ...
   '()

RUNNING ERGO  EXTENDED SOFTWARE

This is done as for Ergo, but using the ergoExt library.

To run interactively:

   racket -l ergoExt -i 

To run interactively after loading an Ergo file myfile.scm:

   racket -l ergoExt -i -f myfile.scm
