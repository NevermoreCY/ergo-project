This directory contains all the files and directions for installing
and running the ERGO EXTENDED system, a branch of the ERGO system
(from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hector/pcr.html) developed primarily
for implementing probabilistic plan recognition systems, including a
number of example programs.  It comes with absolutely no guaranties
or support.  Also, do read the copyright notice.

The extensions were developed by Yves Lesperance
<lesperan@eecs.yorku.ca> at York University.  The author acknowledges
useful discussions and ideas from Alistair Scheuhammer who developped
additional plan recognition examples and tested the Ergo extensions
described here.
